### Logistic Regression - Example with Bank Customer Data 

Imagine I am a **data scientist** working for a major bank. The bank is planning to launch a new credit card and wants to target a specific segment of its customer base for its initial marketing campaign. As a data scientist, my task is to predict which customers are more likely to accept this new credit card offer.

To achieve this, I will use logistic regression, a machine learning algorithm that is particularly useful for predicting binary outcomes - in this case, whether a customer will accept or decline the offer.

I will use a dataset that contains various customer information such as age, income, account balance, credit score, and so on. My job is to analyze this data and develop a predictive model that can effectively identify those customers who are likely to accept the new credit card offer.

By doing this, the bank can ensure that its marketing efforts are targeted and efficient, potentially saving significant resources and increasing the success rate of the campaign.
